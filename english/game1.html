          The economic crisis of the 1930s affected agriculture and industry and led to a financial crisis. <br>One of its consequences was the radicalization of part of the political scene. There were increasing demands for a more authoritative way of governing the state, which would establish greater social justice or, <br>for example, strengthen the country’s nationalist direction.  
          The then government responded to the crisis with loans, organized support events for workers, and distributed food vouchers.

          <p>92.8% of voters took part in the elections.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>Despite the poll results, Konrad Heinlein’s SDP became the absolute winner. <br>The party gained 1.25 million voters or 15.2% of the total.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Agrarians were second and, due to the different weight of votes, they gained one more seat, although a significantly lower number of people voted for them. <br>Most of their voters were from the eastern part of Czechoslovakia.</p>
          <br>
          <p>ČSSD was third and the results were disappointing for the party. The Czechoslovak Fascist Community was also disappointed with gaining only six seats.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The previous coalition resigned due to the elections, as it no longer had a majority. <br>A new group of seven parties and two non-partisans, the so-called broad coalition, was formed. It excluded the winner of the elections, the SDP. The Agrarian Jan Malypetr became the Prime Minister of the new government.</p>             
          <br>
          <p>However, there was no peace on the political scene. Until 1938, five different governments were subsequently in power, the last one being a caretaker government. In the same year, the borderlands of Czechoslovakia were ceded to Germany.</p>             
          <br>
          <p>The Czechoslovak Republic disappeared for several years.</p>
